# HangmanPY
This is a basic CLI game that simulates a one player hangman experience.


# Update
This project is not the most updated verion. For the most updated version visit this link: https://github.com/AndrewAbercrombie/HangmanPY-v2

I originally created this in my first semester Python class in college because I was bored. I at the time of writing this, have released a new version due to the fact that the way this game was created is utter trash. 


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewAbercrombie/HangmanPY

python Hangman.py
```
